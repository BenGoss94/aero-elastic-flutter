\section{Introduction}

Aero-elastic flutter is a phenomena that can occur on aerofoils. It causes unstable oscillations that can increase in amplitude until the aerofoil fails. 
This report will focus on the dynamics of this system, and will analyse the dynamics of a given dataset that models the given system.
